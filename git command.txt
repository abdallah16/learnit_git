Git Branching:

create new branch : git branch <name of branch> ,  example : git branch TA0001

see branch in remote repo : git branch -r
origin/main

see branch in all repo : git branch -a
git branch -a
  TA0001
* main
  remotes/origin/main


create and change to the new branch : 
git checkout -b TA0001_discount_calculation

change or switch  branch : 
git switch main //change the branche to main

git switch -c new_branch // create and change to the "new_branch" //-c: means create

Delete a branch: 
from local : 
git branch -d TA0001
Deleted branch TA0001 (was eafbce7).

from remote repo (note : we are using "push") : 
git push origin --delete <branche name>
